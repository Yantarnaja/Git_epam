Hold on, I know you're scared
But you're so close to heaven
Eyes shut tight
Just pretend you're like a feather

Flew down the clouds together
But don't look down, not ever
Don't ask why
Just look out into forever

All this time
You're just trying not to lose it
You can always learn to fly
You never do until you do it

Up high in the middle of nowhere
Don't know, but you'll know when you get there
Walk slow and low on a tightrope
Hope it lasts but you know, you never know
